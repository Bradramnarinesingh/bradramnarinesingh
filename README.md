# 👋 Hey, I'm Brad!

I'm a computer science student at the University of Toronto who loves turning ideas into working software. Whether it’s training a model to sniff out fake news or building out a responsive website from scratch, I’m all about building things that are both smart and clean.

I'm always looking for ways to push my skills, collaborate with others, and work on projects that make a difference — or just scratch an itch.

## 🔨 What I’ve Been Building

### 🧠 Fake News Classifier (AI + NLP)
I got curious about how misinformation spreads online, so I built a deep learning model that can tell real news from fake. I combined TensorFlow with some classic NLP techniques (like TF-IDF) and ran experiments to tune the model’s accuracy.

### 📊 House Price Predictor
Real estate’s wild — so I built a machine learning model that takes in property data and spits out a price. It uses Gradient Boosting and some custom feature engineering to stay smart and accurate.

### 🌐 My Portfolio Site
This is where I showcase my projects (including this one). Built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, it’s fast, responsive, and sprinkled with little animations for a smoother feel. You’re probably on it right now 👀
