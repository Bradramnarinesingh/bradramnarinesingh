# 👋 Hey, I'm Brad!

I'm a computer science student at the University of Toronto passionate about coding and creative problem solving. I enjoy building software that bridges theory and practice, whether it's a deep learning model or a responsive website. I'm always exploring new ideas and collaborating on projects that make a real impact.

## 🔨 What I’ve Been Building

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bradramnarinesingh/fake-news-detector">🧠 Fake News Classifier (AI + NLP)</a>
I got curious about how misinformation spreads online, so I built a deep learning model that distinguishes real news from fake. It leverages TensorFlow along with classic NLP techniques (like TF-IDF) to fine-tune its accuracy.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bradramnarinesingh/House-Prices-Prediction">📊 House Price Predictor</a>
Real estate is full of surprises. I developed a machine learning model that predicts property prices using Gradient Boosting and custom feature engineering to deliver smart and accurate estimates.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bradramnarinesingh/Portfolio-Website">🌐 My Portfolio Site</a>
This site is my digital playground where I showcase projects, experiments, and ideas. Built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, it's designed to be fast, responsive, and engaging.
